    "## Before we dive into coding\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial aims at making you discover **how to code in solidity** in order to interact with the blockchain. You are going to learn how to **code a Smart Contract, deploy a NFT and mint it in your wallet.**\n",
    "\n",
    "To write this assignment, I was greatly inspired by an article published on freecodecamp. This site is a real gold mine if you want to learn how to code or simply familirize yourself with the computer science world. Every content is free of access and of very good quality, have a look here : [https://www.freecodecamp.org/](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "🛠 **Disclaimer**\n",
    "This tutorial is easily accessible if you are familiar with programming tool. If it’s the first time you hear about terminal, bash, code editor or node.js, **you may need to spend a little bit more time reading outside documentations to get familiar with these notions**. Along this tutorial I put external links for you to get more information. It’s not wasted time for you to do so as it’s more and more useful to understand what these tools are used for in our society where computer science takes a growing part in our lives.\n",

    "### Open your crypto wallet\n",
    "\n",
    " First we need to open a **wallet** to store our crypto currency and our digital assets. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many wallet provider, but I advice you to open a **MetaMak** wallet as it is one of the most spread.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "💡 Here is a nice [Tutorial](https://myterablock.medium.com/how-to-create-or-import-a-metamask-wallet-a551fc2f5a6b) to open a MetaMask Ethereum wallet.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Design your avatar\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to code a smart contract hosting a NFT. This NFT will be your “avatar” for the class. Design an avatar that you will eventually mint as a NFT. It can be whatever you want but it should be a png file. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Download a source code editor\n",
    "\n",
    "A source code editor is a software that enables you to open (almost) any type of code file. This will make it possible for you to open, edit and write your own programs. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you don’t already have one I advice you to download VScode or Sublime text. If you are a beginner, you should choose VScode as it provides more hand-holding and is a great option for its debugging functionality. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a tutorial on how to install [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/windows) and [Sublime Text](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-sublime-text-3-in-windows/).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Install Node.JS on your computer\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using NodeJS for the project. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "💡 If you don't have it installed, follow this simple tutorial : [https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-node-js-npm-on-windows/](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-node-js-npm-on-windows/).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Connect to an Ethereum node with Alchemy\n",
    "\n",
    "To interact with the Ethereum Network, you will need to be connected to an **Ethereum [Node](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Running your own Node and maintaining the infrastructure is a project on its own. Luckily, there are **nodes-as-a-service providers** which host the infrastructure for you. We will be using [**Alchemy**](https://www.alchemy.com/) as our node provider. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "❓ Head over to their website, **create an account**, choose **Ethereum as your network** and create your app. You can choose **Sepolia as your network**. You can also use **Goerli** although it is in the process of being deprecated. It is recommended to use your dashboard, click \"view details\" on your app, then click \"view key\". Save your http key somewhere as we will need that later.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, as you noticed, we will be using the Sepolia testnet. Sepolia is a **testnet** i.e. an instance of Ethereum blockchain used for testing and experimentation without risk to loose real funds or the main chain. That way you’ll learn to write smart contracts and mint NFTs without wasting money if you do a mistake using the mainnet. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "❓ To get some Sepolia, go to one of the faucets (e.g. [https://sepoliafaucet.com/](https://sepoliafaucet.com/)), connect with your Alchemy account and copy paste your public key.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deploy your Smart Contract\n",
    "\n",
    "### Set up your repository\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to use the terminal to create folders and run files throughout the tutorial. If you are not familiar with using your terminal, I suggest you read this [article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/command-line-for-beginners/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure you are in the `C:\\Users\\Name` folder and run this command to create a new directory for your project:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "mkdir nft-project # this will create a folder in the root file of your computer\n",
    "cd nft-project # this will enter the created folder\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's make another directory, `ethereum/`, inside `nft-project/` and initialize it with [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/getting-started/). Hardhat is a development environment that makes it easy to deploy and test your Ethereum software.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "mkdir ethereum #this will create a new folder within the nft-project one\n",
    "cd ethereum #this will enter the newly created ethereum folder\n",
    "npm init # this will \"initialize\" node.js and create a \"package\" file in your ethereum folder.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer the questions however you want. You can press enter to all of them if you want to keep default features.\n",
    "Then, run those commands to make a Hardhat project:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "npm install --save-dev hardhat # install hardhat on your computer, be careful, don't forget the \"-\" between save and dev otherwise it won't work\n",
    "\tnpx hardhat init\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After waiting a moment, you will see this prompt:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",

    "### Define your environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember the Alchemy key we grabbed from our test project earlier? We will use that along with our Metamask account's public and private keys to interact with the blockchain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the following commands to make a file called `.env` inside your `ethereum/` directory, and install [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv). We will use them later.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "npm install touch-cli -g #use npm to install the touch package\n",
    "touch .env #create the .env file\n",

    "- Public key (i.e. wallet address)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "🚨 Be extremely careful when handling your private key. Never share it, never copy paste it in a document accessible to any other person than you.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Open the .env file with the code editor of your choice (I personnaly use VS Code, but Sublime text or any other of your choice will fit) and add your keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your .env file should look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "API_URL = \"YOUR_ALCHEMY_KEY\"\n",
    "PRIVATE_KEY = \"YOUR_METAMASK_PRIVATE_KEY\"\n",
    "PUBLIC_KEY = \"YOUR_METAMASK_ADDRESS\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For the API_URL, be careful to copy paste the whole URL and not only your key. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Code the file\n",
    "\n",
    "Go to the `ethereum/` folder and create two more directories: contracts and scripts. [A simple hardhat project](https://hardhat.org/guides/project-setup.html) contains those folders.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `contracts/` contains the source files of your contracts\n",
    "- `scripts/` contains the scripts to deploy and mint our NFTs\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "mkdir contracts\n",
    "mkdir scripts\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- contracts/ is where we’ll keep our NFT smart contract code\n",
    "- scripts/ is where we’ll keep scripts to deploy and interact with our smart contract\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, install OpenZeppelin. [OpenZeppelin Contract](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/) is an open-sourced library with pre-tested reusable code to make smart contract development easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "npm install @openzeppelin/contracts\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we will be writing the Smart Contract for our NFT. Navigate to your contracts directory and create a file titled `avatar.sol`. You can name your NFTs however you see fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `.sol` extension refers to the Solidity language, which is what we will use to program our Smart Contract. We will only be writing 14 lines of code with Solidity, so no worries if you haven't seen it before.\n",
    "\n",
    "Start with [this article](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/smart-contracts/languages/) to learn more about Smart Contract languages. You can also directly jump to this Solidity [cheat sheet](https://reference.auditless.com/cheatsheet/) which contains the main syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cd contracts\n",
    "touch avatar.sol //create a solidity file\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Open the `avatar.sol` file with your code editor and copy paste the following code (this is our Smart Contract):\n",

    "pragma solidity ^0.8.17; // latest version of solidity\n",
    "\n",
    "import \"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol\"; \n",
    "\n",
    "contract avatar is ERC721 {\n",
    "    uint256 private _tokenIdCounter;\n",
    "\n",

    "        _tokenIdCounter += 1;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's go through the code and understand what is going on:\n",
    "\n",
    "- At the top of the file, we specified which OpenZeppelin module to import.\n",
    "We need the ERC721 contract as it is the 'base' of our Smart Contract.\n",
    "It has already implemented all the methods specified in [EIP-721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721) so we can safely use it. See here for documentation on the different types of smart contracts (token standards) : [https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/)\n",
    "- A Counter is useful to generate incremental ids for our NFTs. Using the `Counters`\n",
    " library, we define unique IDs for every NFT minted using our smart contract. We named the variable `_tokenIdCounter`\n",
    "- In the constructor, we initialized our ERC721 with its name and its symbol. I chose avatar and NAME.\n",
    "- We override the default `_baseURI` function by returning our own. We will get to build that in a second.\n",
    "- In summary, it is the URL that will be added as 'prefix' to all our tokenURIs. In the above example, the metadata of our NFTs will live in a JSON file at `OUR_API_URL/[api/erc721/](https://e110-99-121-58-31.ngrok.io/api/erc721/)1`.\n",
    "- We implement the 'mint' function. It is the function that lets you publish an instance of this Smart Contract on the blockchain. I required the `_tokenIdCounter` variable to be less than 1 as I will only create one instance of my NFT. You can change that if you want to mint more.\n",
    "- Finally, inside the mint function, we increment the `_tokenIdCounter` **variable by 1, so in the case you want to mint many NFTs, our id will be 1, followed by 2, followed by 3 etc until the number your put in line 18.\n",
    "- Then, we call the function provided by OpenZeppelin `_safeMint` to publish the token.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Web app & metadata\n",
    "\n",
    "For the web app, we will use [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started) to initialize a fully-functional web app. \n",
    "\n",
    "Go back to the root directory `nft-project/` and initialize a boilerplate Next.js app called web:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cd .. #command to go back to the previous repository (folder)\n",
    "mkdir web #create a new repository \"web\"\n",
    "cd web #go into that newly created repository\n",
    "npx create-next-app@latest #create a new app using the default Next.js template\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be asked to name your project. Feel free to name it however your want. In this tutorial, we will name our project “avatar”. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Troubleshooting**: If the command \"npx create-next-app@latest\" fail to create a new folder, create it manually. Also reject creating /src and App router folders when generating the next app.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code the metadata\n",
    "\n",
    "**Metadata** is a central pillar of blockchain. It is used to provide additional information or data about an asset that may be useful when trying to complete a transaction with the asset itself. Indeed, our file (our png avatar) can’t be stored directly on chain otherwhise it would be insanely costly to run the network as there would be much more data for computers to process. So we need to host it off-chain. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each NFT will refer to a file stored on the internet and retrieve the file each time it is asked to. ff-line. NFTs usually point to an IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) hash or an HTTP URL somewhere on the Internet. For more information about metadata, read [this post](https://pastel.network/what-exactly-is-nft-metadata/). \n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, we will be building a simple API endpoint which resolve in our NFT's information as a JSON file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our Next.js project gives us a handy way to develop API routes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Go to the `web/` folder, find the `api/` folder within the `pages/` folder, and make our dynamic `[id].js` route in a `erc721/` folder. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can do it by hand or type the following code in your temrinal\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cd web\n",
    "cd avatar\n",
    "cd pages\n",
    "cd api\n",
    "mkdir erc721 //create a new folder called erc721, this is usefull in case you have many different types of contracts\n",
    "cd erc721\n",
    "touch [id].js\n",
    "code [id].js //this command wil open the file with your default code editor\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then open the file with your code editor and code your metadata:\n",
    "\n",
    "```jsx\n",
    "const metadata = {//we add a constant in case we wanted to do a series/collection of many NFTs. This enables to have only 1 JSON file for the metadata of all your NFTs. \n",
    "  0: {\n",
    "    description: \"Name's avatar for the Blockchain class\", //replace Name by your name\n",
    "    image: \"https://i.ibb.co/DC4BPR3/fmex6-avgaei3ue.jpg\", // replace with the png or jpg of your avatar !\n",
    "    name: \"Name's avatar\",//replace Name by your name\n",
    "  }\n",
    "};\n",
    "\n",
    "export default function handler(req, res) {\n",
    "  res.status(200).json(metadata[req.query.id] || {});\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "💡 We are naming the file `[id].js` and not `0.js` for instance because we want to give the possibility to create many js files (1 for each NFT we want to mint) in case we wante to create a whole collection of NFT.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As we don’t have a server to store our image, we will use a free online host service. I used [**imgbb**](https://imgbb.com/) but feel free to use anyone you want. However, never upload personal or sensitive image on such servers. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "🚨 To ensure your picture appears on Opensea, it's crucial to complete the tutorial before the ngrok link expires, typically within an hour.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "🚨 For the sake of this project, I made the code as easily understandable as possible. This is definitely not suited for production, you should add details, maybe properties to your NFT to make it more scarce, give it some properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, go to `/web` directory then `/avatar`, and start your Next.js app (be careful to run it in `/avatar` and not in `/web` otherwise it won’t work):\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cd .. //go back to the avatar directory\n",
    "npm run dev\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It may take some time to run. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your app should be running on localhost:3000. To make sure our endpoint works, go to [http://localhost:3000/api/erc721/0](http://localhost:3000/api/erc721/0) and it should resolve with a JSON object of your first NFT's metadata.\n",

From ethereum.org: An application binary interface, or ABI, is the standard way to interact with [contracts](https://ethereum.org/en/glossary/#contract-account). Your ABI defines how others interact with your contract. Then, we created our provider with Alchemy (remember about node-as-a-service). Finally, we initialize our wallet with our private key.\n",
    "- The `main()` function calls the `mint` method in the Smart Contract we had just deployed. The `mint` method takes only one parameter, `to`, which indicate the receiver of the token. Since we are minting for ourself, we put the public address of our Metamask account.\n",

    "**Troubleshooting:** If you run into an error message, check the [following thread](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/154412/typeerror-cannot-read-properties-of-undefined-reading-match). Note that the issue should not prevent you from minting your NFT.\n",

    "If everything goes well, after a couple of seconds, you should see a response like this in your terminal:\n",

    "First dowload the mobile version of Metamask. \n",
